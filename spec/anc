Does HDMI support closed captions?
    - HDMI cables, cannot carry closed cpations. They can only carry captions after they've been decoded and
      made a visible part of the video signal. So, for all sources connected to your TV by HDMI cables, you
      MUST decode them at the player, recorder, set-top or converter box.
