tpm - Trusted Platform Module
------------------------------

What is a TPM
    - cryptographic processor
    - NOT an accelertor!
        believe it or not, TPMs are slow "by design"

    - key generator
    - encryption descryption / signature engine
    - hash generator (digest + HMAC)

    TPM2.0
        - RSA 1024/2048
        - ECC P256/BN256
        - SHA-1
        - SHA-256

platform: ubuntu 20.04 LTE
package
    tpm2-tools
        v4.1.1
        This package contains a set of tools to use with TPM 2.0 chips,
        for common tasks and features provided by the hardware; such as
        for doing basic key management, attestation, encryption and signing.
    tss2
        v 1045-1.2
        IBM's TCG Software Stack (TSS) for TPM 2.0 and related utilities
         TSS2 is a user space Trusted Computing Group's Software Stack (TSS) for
         TPM 2.0.  It implements the functionality equivalent to the TCG TSS
         working group's ESAPI, SAPI, and TCTI layers (and perhaps more) but with
         a hopefully far simpler interface.
         .
         It comes with about 80 "TPM tools" that can be used for rapid prototyping,
         education and debugging.

This tutorial demonstrates a method to protect application secrets on the TPM
    - The application secret is sealed to a trusted TPM device whose identity is known to be valid.
    - The TPM device and the CPU are bound with a secret. The authorization policy for the sealing 
        object is made dependent on the secret. This offers protection against the attacker ability 
        to transplant the TPM to an attacker controlled CPU to retrieve the secrets.
    - Inhibit the attacker ability to retrieve or replay any of the secrets used for the provisioning 
        and the application-secrets on the CPU<==>TPM interface.
