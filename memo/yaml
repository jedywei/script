 yaml
    * YAML - 
    * list of key/value pairs, hash, directory
    * begin with ---, end with ...
    * all members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space)

    For example
---
# A list of tasty fruits
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango
...

     * A dictionary is represented a simple "key: value" form (the colon must be followed by a space):
    For example
# An employee record
martin:
  name: Martin D'vloper
  job: Developer
  skill: Elite

     * More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries, dictionaries whose values are lists
            or a mix of both:

# Employee records
- martin:
  name: Martin D'vloper
  job: Developer
  skills: 
    - python
    - perl
    - pascal
- tabitha:
    name: Tabitha Bitumen
    job: Developer
    skills:
      - lisp
      - fortran
      - erlang

      * Dictonaries an lists can also be represented in a abbreviated form if you really want to:
---
martin: {name: Martin D'vloper, job: Developer, skill: Elite}
frutes: ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Strawberry', 'Mango']

      * boolean value     (lower case 'true' or 'false' for boolean values in dictionaries if you wan to be compatible with 
                             defalut yamllint options.)
create_key: yes
need_agent: no
knows_oop: True
likes_emacs: TRUE
uses_cvs: false

      * | or > Values can span multiple lines using | or >. 

include_newlines: |
            exactly as you see
            will appear these three
            lines of poetry

fold_newlines: >
            this is really a
            single line of text
            despite appearances
