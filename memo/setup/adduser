$ sudo usermod -a -G video jedywei

# NOTE
# Primary and supplementary groups for a process are normally inherited from its parent and are usually 
# unchanged since login. This means that if you change the group database after logging in, groups will 
# not reflect your changes within your existing login session. Running `groupsâ€™ with a list of users 
# causes the user and group database to be consulted afresh, and so will give a different result.

$ getent group jedywei
$ getent passwd jedywei

NOTE
The adduser command creates a new user and additional information about the user, directories, and a password. 
The useradd command is used for creating a new user or for modifying the existing user.
