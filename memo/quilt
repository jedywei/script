quilt add log.c         // file you want to modify under this patch. 
quilt add log.h         // use quilt remove log.h to remove the file from watching
// After log.c and log.h modifiction, to refesh patch
quilt refresh           // it will generate the real patch


Walk through patches
---------------------
quilt series            // 查詢有哪些patches
quilt top               // 查詢 topmost patch
quilt applied           // 查詢已經applied那些patches
quilt unapplied         // 查詢還沒apply那些patches
quilt next              // 查詢下一個要apply的patch

quilt files             // 查詢目前 patch 中更動的 files or files watched by topmost patch

quilt header            // look up topmost patch's header
quilt header -a         // append a header description to the topmost patch (ctrl-D to end of editing)


Apply to or restore from patches
---------------------------------
quilt push              // apply next patch
quilt push -a           // apply all patch

quilt pop               // undo one applied patch
quilt pop -a            // undo all patches


quilt rename <new-name>     // you can rename the topmost patch

quilt import /tmp/the-patch -P <better-patch-name>  // it insert the imported patch after the topmost patch

quilt delete 04_hyphen-manpage.patch    // remove the patch from series file
quilt delete -r 04_hyphen-manpage.patch // remove the pathc file and also remove the patch from series file


Look up patch by file
---------------------
quilt annotate <file>       // Print an annotated listing of the specified file showing which patches modify which lines.
