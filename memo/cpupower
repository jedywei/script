$ cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 400 MHz - 4.70 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 400 MHz and 4.70 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 1.35 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes

Cpu speed from cpuinfo 1689.00Mhz
cpuinfo might be wrong if cpufreq is enabled. To guess correctly try estimating via tsc
Linux's inbuilt cpu_khz code emulated now
True Frequency (without accounting Turbo) 1689 MHz
  CPU Multiplier 17x || Bus clock frequency (BCLK) 99.35 MHz

Socket [0] - [physical cores=4, logical cores=8, max online cores ever=4]
  TURBO ENABLED on 4 Cores, Hyper Threading ON
  Max Frequency without considering Turbo 1788.35 MHz (99.35 x [18])
  Max TURBO Multiplier (if Enabled) with 1/2/3/4 Cores is  47x/47x/41x/41x

C0 = Processor running without halting
C1 = Processor running with halts (States >C0 are power saver modes with cores idling)
C3 = Cores running with PLL turned off and core cache turned off
C6, C7 = Everything in C3 + core state saved to last level cache, C7 is deeper than C6
  Above values in table are in percentage over the last 1 sec
[core-id] refers to core-id number in /proc/cpuinfo
