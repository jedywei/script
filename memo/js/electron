Electron
--------
Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell[5]) is a free and open-source software framework developed and maintained
by OpenJS Foundation.[6] The framework is designed to create desktop applications using web technologies (mainly 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although other technologies such as front-end frameworks and Web Assembly are possible) 
that are rendered using a version of the Chromium browser engine and a back end using the Node.js runtime 
environment.[7] It also uses various APIs to enable functionality such as native integration with Node.js services 
and an inter-process communication module.
