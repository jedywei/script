What is this?

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method         ->  this refers to the object (instance)
Alone                       ->  this refers to the global object.
In a function               ->  this refers to the global object. 
In a function (strict mode) ->  this is undefined
In an event                 ->  this refers to the element that received the event. 

Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;        // this in a Method
  }
};

Example
let x = this;       // alone, refers to the global object
x == global;        // true
x == this;          // true


Game.prototype.restart = function () {
    this.clearLocalStorage();
    const self = this;   // <------ Save reference to 'this', while itâ€™s still this!
    this.timer = setTimeout(function(){
        self.clearBoard();    // Oh, OK, I do know who 'self' is!
    }, 0);
};
