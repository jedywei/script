Content negotiation
    
In HTTP, content negotiation is the mechanism that is used for serving differnt representions of a resource. 

    1. Specific HTTP headers by the client (server-driven negotiation or proative negotiation), which is the 
        standard way of negotiating a specific kind of resource. 
    2. The 300 (Multiple Choices) or 406 (Not Acceptable), 415 (Unsupported Media Type) HTTP response codes
        by server (agent-driven negotiation or reactive negotiation), that are used as fallback mechanisms.
