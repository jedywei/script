# NOTE
# Primary and supplementary groups for a process are normally inherited from its parent and are usually 
# unchanged since login. This means that if you change the group database after logging in, groups will 
# not reflect your changes within your existing login session. Running `groupsâ€™ with a list of users 
# causes the user and group database to be consulted afresh, and so will give a different result.
